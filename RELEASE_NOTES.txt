* in development

=============================
=== Current Release Goals ===
=============================

Currently, stock, stock_item and stock_status represent an accumulation of inventory data and rules for products. The product quantities are included as well, and function as single source for inventory count. I'd like to add warehouses. Each warehouse represents both a location and inventory count for any number of available stock items. A warehouse shall be affiliated to a store. On update routines of quantity for stock status, it shall be an accumulation of product count from the warehouses affiliated to a given store. On update routines of quantity for stock item, it shall be an accumulation of product count from stock status; an overall available total quantity.

Though the ability to create multiple warehouses shall exist, for the purpose of laying the foundation, only the assigned "default" warehouse will matter.
